You can display the temporal evolution of the K activation variable n in a State Graph window. Go to NEURON Main Menu – Graph – State Axis. When the window opens, right click on it and choose Plot What. Double click on soma and then on n_hh, which represents the K activation variable. The Na activation and inactivation variables are represented by m_hh and h_hh, respectively (add these to the window with the n plot). To display all activation and inactivation variables in the same window, change the colour of the traces by right clicking and choosing the Color/Brush option, selecting a colour and clicking on the trace in the window (if you have trouble setting the colour, right click and select Crosshairs, and then right click again and reselect Color/Brush). Tip for write up/essay: you can use screenshots of these plot windows for figures in you write up. Ensure numbers on axes will be legible in final figure. They will have to be further annotated in Word, etc. to add labels for axes & traces. If you really want to make your own graphs, right click, select Pick Vector, click on the trace to save, go to the main menu, select Vector -> Save to file, and the file saved can be imported into Excel.


Set the Na conductance back to its default value of 0.12 S/cm2, and repeat the voltage clamp experiments with the K channel conductance set to 0, noting the different behaviours of the activation and inactivation variables. Do this for a few different testing voltages (e.g. 10 mV, -10 mV, -30 mV, -50 mV). You can overlay the plots by right clicking into a graph and selecting Keep Lines.
