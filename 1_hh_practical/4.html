Keep in mind that the clamp current and the clamp voltage displayed in Graph[0] are the only two variables that were accessible to Hodgkin and Huxley in their experiments, the variables that are shown in the other windows are not directly observable and only accessible in our simulation. 

In order to study the K current alone, Hodgkin and Huxley replaced Na ions in the external solution with an impermeant cation, thus eliminating the contribution of the ion flow through the Na channels to the measured currents. You can replicate this in the simulation by setting the Na channel conductance in the Simulation Parameters window to 0. Run the simulation again by clicking on Init & Run, and notice that the negative peak in the clamp current disappears. When looking more carefully at the time courses of the K current and conductance (in the VClamp[0] Graph window and in Graph[1]and Graph[2] windows), you will notice that they start with a slow rise and speed up before settling down into the steady state value. In order to reproduce this shape, Hodgkin and Huxley had to raise the K activation variable n to the fourth power:
