In the first voltage clamp experiment, step the voltage from resting potential (in this case, -63.77 mV) to a testing level of -10 mV for 30 ms. In order to do this, change the testing level amplitude to -10 mV and hit return (the appearance of a red tick mark will always tell you that have changed a parameter from its default value). Click on Init & Run in the RunControl window to run the simulation.
To see the clamp current you have to adjust the axes of the VClamp[0] Graph window. Right click into this window, select View…-> Set View, accept the X Size and change the Y Size for example to [–3 3] (the current is given in nA). Note: the View…-> View = Plot function is also useful for automatically resizing the axes to fit a graph. You will notice four distinct currents during the course of the simulation:

<ul>
	<li>A very brief positive spike at the onset of the voltage change. This is the capacitive current that is related to charging the membrane capacitance.</li>
	<li>A negative peak that represents the extra current needing to be injected to counteract the inward current through the fast sodium channels and hold the voltage constant.</li>
	<li>A sustained positive (outward) current in response to the increased potassium conductance. </li>
	<li>A smaller transient current after the voltage clamp returns to resting membrane potential. There is an instantaneous change in the driving force the current through the potassium channels experiences, and the gates in channels gradually close at this membrane potential.</li>
</ul>
