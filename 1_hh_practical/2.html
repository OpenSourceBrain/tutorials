Also, typing psection() in the command line interface (nrniv) shows a summary of the parameters for the currently accesses section. Some of the parameters that can be seen there are:

	gnabar_hh	Na+ max conductance density			0.12 S/cm2
	gkbar_hh	K+ max conductance density			0.036 S/cm2
	gl_hh		Leak conductance density			0.0003 S/cm2
	el_hh		Reversal potential leak conductance		-54.3 mV
	nai		[Na+] inside					10 mM
	nao		[Na+] outside					140 mM
	ki		[K+] inside					54.4 mM
	ko		[K+] outside					2.5 mM

Next, switch to voltage clamp mode by clicking on the VClamp button in the I/V Clamp Electrode window. In each voltage clamp experiment, a variable current is injected into the compartment in order to keep the voltage successively at three constant levels: a conditioning level, a testing level and a return level. Click on the VClamp.igraph button at the bottom of the I/V Clamp Electrode window in order to display this clamp current.
