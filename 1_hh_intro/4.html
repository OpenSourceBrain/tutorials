Leak currents, synaptic currents and voltage or ligand gated channel currents are commonly described by the product of a conductance (reciprocal of the resistance) <b>g<sub>i</sub></b> and a driving force <b>(V – E<sub>i</sub>)</b>, where <b>E<sub>i</sub></b> is the reversal potential that depends on the internal and external concentrations of ions flowing through the channel (Ohm’s law):

While the conductance of a leak current is independent of membrane potential, the conductances of voltage gated channels are functions of time and voltage and can be described according to the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism by the product of a maximum conductance gmax and activation (m or n) and (optional) inactivation variables (h) that can be raised to powers p and q, respectively:

Examples of these types of conductances as described by Hodgkin and Huxley in the squid giant axon are:

The precise dynamics of the activation and inactivation variables depend on the microscopic changes in the structure of the porous membrane proteins with altered cross membrane voltages. The temporal evolution of the activation and inactivation variables <b>x = {n, m, h}</b> can be described by:

where <b>x<sub>∞</sub> = {n<sub>∞</sub>, m<sub>∞</sub>, h<sub>∞</sub>}</b> is the steady state (constant voltage) activation or inactivation and <b>τ<sub>x</sub></b> is the activation or inactivation time constant (a measure of the time to reach a steady state). Both of these parameters are voltage dependent; in the case of <b>x<sub>∞</sub></b>  the voltage dependence is usually sigmoidal and can be described by an equation of the form (constant k and Vh):
