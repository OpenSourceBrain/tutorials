Computational neuroscience uses mathematical analyses and computer simulations to study 
the behaviour of single neurons and neuronal networks. The two most important mathematical 
concepts that are used to model single neurons are the cable equation and the Hodgkin-Huxley 
equations. The cable equation describes the spatio-temporal evolution of the voltage in 
neurites (it was originally developed to model trans-Atlantic cables).

where <b>R<sub>i</sub></b> is the axial resistance, <b>C<sub>m</sub></b> the membrane capacitance and <b>R<sub>m</sub></b> the membrane resistance 
(ignoring for the moment voltage dependent conductances). For most neurons with complex dendritic 
geometries, the cable equation cannot be solved analytically and the change of the voltage as a 
function of space and time is calculated numerically by discretising the equation. This involves 
breaking up the neuron into a number of iso-potential compartments that can be represented by an 
equivalent circuit diagram.
