In the diagram above, <b>V<sub>j</sub></b> is the voltage inside compartment j, <b>CM<sub>j</sub></b> is the membrane capacitance, and <b>g<sub>i,j</sub></b> and <b>E<sub>i,j</sub></b> 
are the conductances and reversal potentials of the different currents across the membrane. 
Compartment j is connected to its neighbours k and l by axial resistances <b>RI<sub>j</sub></b> and <b>RI<sub>l</sub></b>.
