A) A typical experiment on a neuron which is to be modelled. A current I is injected and the membrane potential V is recorded. The outline of the dendrites (3D position, radii) is recorded also.
B) An equivalent cable model of the neuron is created, with cylindrical compartments for dendritic sections, which are considered isopotential.
C) The circuit diagram for the cell model which will be simulated.
